    <h1>Neat game</h1>
    <p>This is a POC game with an AI using neuro evolution to learn how to play.</p>
    <p>The goal is simple, the blue cube just need to avoid the falling red cubes that have a random spawn.</p>
    <p>Generation : this is the current batch of blue cubes that will be then use to evolve. When all the blue cubes have been destroyed an other generation will be created.</p>
    <p>Population : this is just the number of blue cubes in the generation. 
      We need a lot of cubes to have at least one that will do a better score than the others and can be used to "bread".</p>
    <p>Score : consider that if the score is going higher than 2000, the AI learned to play the game and will never fail.</p>

    <h1>How to use : </h1>
    <p>The AI can take up to a thousand generations to be trained so feel free to use the button 'Change speed' to have a x100 accelerated process, click on it again to come back to the original speed.</p>
    <p>You can hit the 'S' key to save your player.</p>
    <p>There is already a good player saved, so if you want you can just click on 'Run best' to see an AI that learned to play without the training process.
      Click on the button again to return to training mode.</p>
